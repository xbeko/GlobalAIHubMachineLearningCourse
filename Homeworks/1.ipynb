"1) Machine learning is a method paradigm that makes inferences from existing data using mathematical and statistical methods and makes predictions about the unknown with these inferences. It is a system that investigates the work and construction of algorithms that can learn as a structural function and make predictions over data.\n",
"2) Supervised Learning, a link is established between input data and output data. Training data also consists of these two data. As an example, linear and logistic regression are multi-class classification. Unsupervised Learning is created by using data that does not contain a classification as input data. For example hierarchical clustering, k-means, Expectation – maximization algorithm. \n",
"3) Validation data set is a sub-dataset used to evaluate the performance of the model obtained during the training phase. The validation set is used for model selection and final model. It is a dataset used to evaluate the model developed in a training set. The test data set is used to evaluate the future performance of the model and to predict error. \n"
